Munich, the third biggest city in Germany, has more than 1.5 million inhabitants and is famous for its beer, folk festival, beautiful English gardens and of course, also for 
its universities and a variety of businesses.
Vienna, the capital of Austrian, has more than 1.9 million people. It has been known for a long time that the design of Vienna is balanced and elegant. Every corner of the city tells 
its special story. 

As young scholars, who are going to choose their first jobs after their university studies, it must be interesting and relevant to get more insights on the city life before
moving there. Moreover, the question where you should set your home will be also provided with argumentative answers.


On the German Wikipedia website (https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCnchen), we can find the table on all the 25 boroughs of Munich with their areas, numbers of inhabitants and
the proportion of foreigners.
on the website (https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wien) the table with the same structure can be easily found. 
Using Foursquare geo data I would like to explore these two cities and get the top 10 common venues for each borough of the two cities. Similar boroughs of a city
will be clustered by KMeans and visualized through two interactive maps. 

Let's begin.
